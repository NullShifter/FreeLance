            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                An online nonprofit thrift store named ‘Oldscool’
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Confused?</h2>
            <p>
                Basically imagine combining Goodwill and Amazon, for a better cause
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What's Our Mission?</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to help homeless and disadvantaged people feel less alienated from society. We will provide people access
                to a free, everchanging supply of clean clothes via public computers (libraries, community centers, etc.).
                This presents the opportunity to blend in with society and live free of shame and discrimination.
            </p>

            <p>

                You have to be proud of the way you look to feel empowered, but sadly that costs a price in today's world. At Oldscool, we
                believe that EVERYONE should feel proud and empowered, everyday, no matter what your financial situation
                is! We’re doing something to make that happen.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What are we doing???</h2>
            <p>
                We’re revolutionizing thrifting by creating an online thrifting experience that is fun, easy, and affordable for everyone.
                Donations are curated into 12 piles (types of looks). Stylists decide what is worth selling and group together
                similar items. These 12 piles are called ‘volumes’. You shop the vol.’s that speak to you, and not the ones
                that dont, simple as that. (unlike goodwill where you have to look through the entire store just to find
                one thing you love.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll also have a ‘lookout’ feature, so no more FOMO! (fear.of.missing.out) You just state what you want in an item, like
                price, color, size, brand, vol., etc., and we’ll let you know when that something is posted online! Other
                features could include (with a paid membership), a tailoring feature, early access to all items, deals, and
                much more.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What about the free clothes?</h2>
            <p>
                When donations are damaged (stained, etc.), outdated (not trendy), or basic (plain tshirts, socks, etc.) they are put into
                a 13th volume! All items in vol. 13 are listed for free, and buyer pays shipping. If you register with vol.
                13, and prove you need financial assistance, everything is 100% free (shipping, returns, etc.) (funded by
                vol. 1-12 profits)
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, people who are homeless would use public computers at locations partnered with Oldscool to get on this website.
                They’d first sign in, then shop their wardrobe for the week. Then the next week they would come in and pick
                up their box, and place a new order for the next week. When they’ve worn everything throughout the week,
                they’d bring back the clothes, favorite the items online that they’d like to have back with their next order,
                and return their items. The clothes will be picked up, washed, and put back into vol. 13 for someone else
                in the world to use, unless it was favorited, then it’d just be cleaned and returned. They’d then put in
                a new order to pick up the next week, and on the way out grab their newly delivered box they ordered the
                week before. This is basically their own online close, so they never have to look or feel like anything less
                than their best.

            <h2>How?</h2>
            <p>
                Profits from vol. 1-12 are used to fund vol. 13, the social program giving people in need, simple, shameless, reliable access
                to clean, and often stylish clothes.

            <h2>Our message</h2>
            <p>
                Oldscool pushes for love and acceptance; standing for self expression, natural beauty, and minimalism. All while pushing
                the thrifting trend forward by transforming the thrifting experience into something fun, easy, and affordable
                for everyone.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Fun Fact! </h2>
            <p>
                We’ll also convert decommissioned school busses into pop-up shops/donation centers. These busses will collect and distribute
                donations, organize fundraisers/events, and act as mobile stores (with all 13 volumes included, so EVERYONE
                can enjoy shopping) These busses help a lot of people and do a lot of great things, which is so cool, so
                they’re named the s’cool busses! SO COOL RIGHT?!
            </p>
            <p>
                AND HEY! RECYCLED FASHION IS GREAT FOR THE PLANET! Just another reason why Oldscool is so cool, because old really IS cool!
